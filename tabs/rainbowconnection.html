RAINBOW CONNECTION
Kermit the Frog

G                 Em    Am                D
Why are there so many   Songs about rainbows
G                 Em    C
And what's on the other side
G                 Em   Am                D
Rainbow's are visions  They're only illusions
G                  Em         C
And rainbows have nothing to hide

C
So we've been told and some chose to Believe it
Bbmaj7
But I know they're wrong wait and see

Am           D         Bm         E
Someday we'll find it  The Rainbow Connection
Am              D           G
The lovers, the dreamers and me


G                    Em   Am                   D
Who said that every wish  Would be heard and answered
     G             Em       C
When wished on the morning star
G        Em              Am           D
Somebody thought of that And someone believed it
G                  Em       C
And look what it's done so far

C
What's so amazing That keeps us star gazing
Bbmaj7
What do we think we might see

Am            D         Bm            E
Someday we'll find it  That Rainbow Connection
Am              D          G
The lovers the dreamers and me

G                Em        Am               D
Have you been half asleep  And have you heard voices
G               Em          C
I've heard them calling my name
G                Em            Am       D
Are these the sweet sounds that called  The young sailors
G              Em            C
I think they're one and the same

C
I've heard it too many times to ignore it
Bbmaj7
There's something that I'm supposed to be

Am              D      Bm             E
Someday we'll find it  The Rainbow Connection
Am              D          G
The lovers, the dreamers and me
