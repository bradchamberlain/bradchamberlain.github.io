           Riff 1                  Riff 2                         Riff 3
 
 Riff 1                       Riff 1
 She said that time is unfair to a woman her age
 Riff 1                       Riff 1
 And now that wisdom has come everything else fades
 F                       C                      Riff 1x2

 What she thought were lies, she later found was truth

 F                          C                      Riff 2X2
 And her mother's to blame for the way she is today
 
 G                      Cadd9
 Life's river shall rise, she said
 G                       Cadd9
 And only the strong shall survive, she said                      verse
 G                       Cadd9
 But I'm feeling quite weak, she said
 G                          Cadd9        Riff2x2   
 Will you comfort and forgive me, she said
 
 Riff 2                         Riff 2
 She said she's still searching for salvation's light
 Riff 2                 Riff 2
 Yet she wishes all day and she prays all night

 F                           C                    Riff 2x2
 And it's moments like these she hates to be alone
 
 G                     Cadd9
 Life's river shall rise, she said
 G                      Cadd9
 And only the strong shall survive, she said
 G                      Cadd9
 But I'm feeling quite weak, she said

 Will you comfort and forgive me, she said
