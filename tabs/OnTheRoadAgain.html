I've been playin' in rock and roll bands for 25 years, but it's always good to have a
country tune ready if requested.        dstamm@postoffice.ptd.net
ON THE ROAD AGAIN  by Willie Nelson

[Verse]
<span>E</span>                                                       <span>G#m</span>
On the road again, just can't get wait to get on the road again.
                        <span>F#m</span>
I find love is makin' music with my friends.
        <span>A</span>                        <span>B</span>             <span>E</span>
And I can't wait to get on the road again.

<span>E</span>                                                       <span>G#m</span>
On the road again, going places that I've never been.
                        <span>F#m</span>
Seein' things that I may never see again.
        <span>A</span>                        <span>B</span>             <span>E</span>
And I can't wait to get on the road again.

[Bridge]
        <span>A</span>                                                       <span>E</span>
On the road again, like a band of gypsies we go down the highway
             <span>A</span>                                                    <span>E</span>                  <span>B</span>
We're the best of friends, insisting that the world keep turnin' our way, and our way.

[Verse]
<span>E</span>                                                       <span>G#m</span>
On the road again, just can't get wait to get on the road again.
                        <span>F#m</span>
I find love is makin' music with my friends.
        <span>A</span>                        <span>B</span>             <span>E</span>
And I can't wait to get on the road again.
