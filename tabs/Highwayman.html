<span>Bm</span> 


[Verse 1] 

(Willie Nelson)

<span>Bm</span>       <span>A</span>                     <span>G</span>                <span>Bm</span> 
I was a highwayman, along the coach roads I did ride
<span>A</span>          <span>G</span>      <span>D</span>     <span>A</span>
Sword and pistol by my side
<span>Em</span>      <span>Bm</span>                  <span>A</span>              <span>G</span>
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
<span>Em</span>     <span>Bm</span>                <span>A</span>                <span>G</span>
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
<span>Bm</span>            <span>A</span>                <span>G</span>        <span>A</span>     <span>D</span>
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty five
<span>Bm</span>         <span>G</span>     <span>A</span>
But I am still alive


[Verse 2]

(Kris Kristofferson)

<span>Bm</span>       <span>A</span>             <span>G</span>            <span>Bm</span> 
I was a sailor, I was born upon the tide
<span>A</span>         <span>G</span>     <span>D</span>    <span>A</span>
With the sea I did abide
<span>Em</span>            <span>Bm</span>               <span>A</span>           <span>G</span>
I sailed a schooner round the horn of Mexico
<span>Em</span>      <span>Bm</span>                   <span>A</span>               <span>G</span>
I went aloft and furled the main sail in a blow
<span>Bm</span>            <span>A</span>                    <span>G</span>       <span>A</span>      <span>D</span>
And when the yards broke off they say that I got killed
<span>Bm</span>        <span>G</span>       <span>A</span>
But I am living still


[Verse 3]

(Waylon Jennings)

<span>Bm</span>       <span>A</span>                     <span>G</span>             <span>Bm</span>
I was a dam builder, across a river deep and wide
<span>A</span>                <span>G</span>     <span>D</span>      <span>A</span>
Where steel and water did collide
<span>Em</span>              <span>Bm</span>             <span>A</span>        <span>G</span>
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
<span>Em</span>            <span>Bm</span>             <span>A</span>              <span>G</span>
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
<span>Bm</span>           <span>A</span>               <span>G</span>          <span>A</span>       <span>D</span>
They buried me in that gray tomb that knows no sound
<span>Bm</span>         <span>G</span>     <span>A</span>
But I am still around


[Bridge]

(All)

                 <span>D</span>           <span>D/C#</span>        <span>Bm</span>          <span>A</span>           <span>G</span>      <span>D/F#</span>
I'll always be around, and around, and around, and around, and around...
<span>Em</span> <span>G</span> <span>A</span> <span>D</span>


[Verse 4]

(Johnny Cash)

<span>Bm</span>           <span>A</span>                 <span>G</span>          <span>Bm</span> 
I'll fly a starship across the universe divide
<span>A</span>           <span>G</span>        <span>D</span>      <span>A</span>
And when I reach the other side
<span>Em</span>           <span>Bm</span>                <span>A</span>          <span>G</span>
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
<span>Em</span>         <span>Bm</span>           <span>A</span>           <span>G</span>
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
<span>Bm</span>        <span>A</span>           <span>G</span>       <span>A</span>      <span>D</span>
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
<span>Bm</span>     <span>G</span>      <span>A</span>
But I will remain


[Outro]

(All)
                   <span>D</span>         <span>D/C#</span>        <span>Bm</span>         <span>A</span>          <span>G</span>     <span>D/F#</span>
And I'll be back again, and again, and again, and again, and again...
<span>Em</span> <span>G</span> <span>A</span> <span>D</span> </pre>
