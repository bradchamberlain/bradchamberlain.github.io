Here is Def Leppard's accoustic song from the soundtrack to Last<br>Action Hero.  I saw them in concert at the Minnesota State Fair and got some<br>of the chords from there, the rest I picked off of the radio.<br>					Scott Hagberg (hagbergs@stolaf.edu)<br>			<br>		Two Steps Behind  -  Def Leppard<br><br>Intro:  [A]  [D]  [G]  [D]  (x2)<br><br>Verse:<br>	      [A]  [D]        [G]       [D] <br>	Walk away,     if you want to.<br>	      [A]  [D]        [G]       [D] <br>	It's okay      if you need to.<br>		[A]	 [D]           [E]   [D]<br>	You can run, but you can never hide<br>		   [A]          [D]        [E]    [D]<br>	From the shadow that's creepin up beside you.<br><br>Chorus:<br>  [F#m]                           [D]	<br>	There's a magic runnin' through your soul<br>	    [G]   		   [E]<br>	But you can't have it all.

It only leads to disappointment.&quot;<br>					-Edward Van Halen<br>
