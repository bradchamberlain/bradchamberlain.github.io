Intro: C  F  D7  C  G  C

<u><small>Chorus 1:</small></u>
C                                            C                                       G
I sure do like those Christmas cookies sugar I sure do like those Christmas cookies babe
C                        C7         F                    D7 
The ones that look like Santa Claus Christmas trees and bells and stars
  C                  G                 C
I sure do like those Christmas cookies babe


<u><small>Verse 1:</small></u>
    C                                       F
Now Christmas cookies are a special treat The more she bakes the more I eat
    G                               C
And sometimes I can't get myself to stop Sometimes she'll wait til I'm asleep
           F                                   G                                   C
And she'll take the ones that I didn't eat And put those little sprinkley things on top


<u><small>REPEAT CHORUS 1</small></u>


<u><small>Verse 2:</small></u>
    C                                                    F
Now those sprinkley things just make things worse Cause it makes em taste better than they did at first
    G                                C
And they're absolutely impossible to resist Some disappear to who knows where
           F                            G                                             C
But I make sure I get my share And those kids just stand there waiting for the ones I miss



<u><small>Chorus 2:</small></u>
C                                            C                                       G
I sure do like those Christmas cookies sugar I sure do like those Christmas cookies babe
C                        C7         F                    D7 
She gets mad if they're all gone Before she gets the icing put on
  C                  G                 C
I sure do like those Christmas cookies babe



<u><small>Verse 3:</small></u>
    C                                         F
Now there's a benefit to all of this That you might have overlooked or missed
    G                                       C
So now let me tell you the best part of it all Every time she sticks another batch in the oven 
           F                                              G                                      C
There's fifteen minutes for some kissin' and huggin' That's why I eat Christmas cookies all year long
