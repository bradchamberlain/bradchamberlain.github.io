<span>D</span>                          <span>A</span>      <span>D</span>
Said the night wind to the little lamb
<span>D</span>               <span>G</span> <span>D</span>
Do you see what I see
<span>D</span>                 <span>A</span>      <span>D</span>
Way up in the sky little lamb
<span>D</span>               <span>G</span>  <span>D</span>
Do you see what I see
  <span>Bm</span>      <span>F#</span>    <span>A</span>              <span>Bm</span>  
A star, a star, dancing in the night 
       <span>G</span>       <span>A</span>        <span>F#</span> 
With a tail as big as a kite

With a tail as big as a kite

Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy
<span>D</span>                <span>G</span> <span>D</span>
Do you hear what I hear? 
<span>D</span>                     <span>A</span>        <span>D</span>
Ringing thru the sky, shepherd boy
<span>D</span>                <span>G</span> <span>D</span>
Do you hear what I hear? 
  <span>Bm</span>      <span>F#</span>   <span>A</span>              <span>Bm</span>  
A song, a song High above the tree 
       G        A          F#
With a voice as big as the sea 
       G        A          D
With a voice as big as the sea

A Child, a Child Shivers in the cold 
       G         A          F#
Let us bring Him silver and gold 
       G         A          D
Let us bring Him silver and gold

Pray for peace, people ev'rywhere 
D              G D
Listen to what I say!

The Child, the Child Sleeping in the night 
        G        A            F#
He will bring us goodness and light 
        G        A            D
He will bring us goodness and light
