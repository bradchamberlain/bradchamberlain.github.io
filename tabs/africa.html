(capo 2nd fret)

[Intro]

    G  Bm   G  Bm   G  Bm   G  Bm

[Verse 1]
A                   C#m       F#m 
I hear the drums echoing tonight
         F#m/E        G       Bm        F#m  G  Bm 
She hears only whispers of some quiet conversation 
A             C#m               F#m 
She's coming in, twelve thirty flight
         F#m/E     G                    Bm      F#m  G Bm 
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
A           C#m             F#m 
I stopped an old man along the way
       F#m/E        G             Bm              F#m G     Bm 
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies 
A           C#m         F#m 
He turned to me as if to say
F#m/E           G                  Bm 
Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you


[Chorus]
Em                 C             G         D 
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
Em                        C              G            D 
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
Em             C          G   D 
I bless the rains down in Africa
Em                 C              G 
Gonna take some time to do the things we never
Bm     D    Em     D   G      Bm 
Had                     oo, ooo

[Verse 2]
A             C#m            F#m 
The wild dogs cry out in the night
   F#m/E              G                Bm      F#m G   Bm 
As they grow restless longing for some solitary company
A          C#m              F#m 
I know that I must do what's right
           F#m/E       G           Bm               F#m G   Bm 
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
A         C#m                F#m 
I seek to cure what's deep inside...
F#m/E              G                       Bm 
Frightened of this thing that I've become 


[Chorus]
Em                C              G         D 
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
Em                     C              G               D 
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
Em          C             G   D 
I bless the rains down in Africa
Em              C              G 
Gonna take some time to do the things we never
Bm     D    Em     D   G      Bm 
Had                    oo, ooo...

A  C#m  F#m  F#m/E            G                      Bm
            Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you 


[Chorus]
Em                C              G         D 
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
Em                     C              G               D 
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

I bless the rains down in Africa
Em          C             G   D 
I bless the rains down in Africa
Em          C             G   D 
I bless the rains down in Africa
Em          C             G   D 
I bless the rains down in Africa
Em              C              G 
Gonna take some time to do the things we never
Bm     D    Em     D   G      Bm 
Had--------------- oo, ooo...
