Imagination Movers
Jump Up (Not Movers Music version)

The kids love this one.  I know that the verses are wrong, but my kids 
are only resting during the verses, they are waiting for the chorus to
start dancing.

I just strum once for each chord during the verse and let it ring for 
the measure (line).  The chorus strum pattern is quicker, I've tried 
to indicate my strumming pattern by the musical notes.

If you figure out what the verse is email me:  brads6string@hotmail.com
