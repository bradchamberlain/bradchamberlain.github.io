       A                    E7
It's a world of laughter, a world of tears 
                            A
It's a world of hopes and a world of fears 
                        A7               D          Bm7
There's so much that we share, that it's time we're aware 
       E7                A
It's a small world after all 

A                  E7
It's a small world after all 
                   A
It's a small world after all 
       A7                Bm7
It's a small world after all 
       E7           A
It's a small, small world 

         A                     E7
There is just one moon and one golden sun 
                                A
And a smile means friendship to everyone 
                       A7           D          Bm7
Though the mountains divide and the oceans are wide 
       E7                A
It's a small world after all 

A                  E7
It's a small world after all 
                   A
It's a small world after all,
       A7          D     Bm7
It's a small world after all 
       E7           A
It's a small, small world </pre>
