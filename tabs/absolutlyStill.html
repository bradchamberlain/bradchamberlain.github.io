Tabbed by:blakem1289

I heard this new Better Than Ezra song and noticed that no one had tabbed it out yet, so 
decided that I would give it a try. This is my first tab so it’s not too great, but I 
it works well enough. Feel free to make any comments or suggestions. Thanks.

Verse 1:
This grey room,
This bunker,
The air is humming
us to sleep

While outside,
the city hurries;
the endless worries
are out of reach

Pre-Chorus:
   Bm                             G5 
Promise me we'll never leave this room,
  Bm                                    G5 D/F# E7sus4
a million years from now would be too soon.

Chorus:
  D5
The world is spinning turning day to night
  A
and my thoughts are running at the speed of light
 Bm                                      G5
Got an empty feeling that I never want to fill
 G5 D/F# E7sus4
absolutely still
 D5
I waited longer 'cause I needed proof
 A
that every door I shut is leading me to you
 Bm                                               G5
and there's a nervous feeling that i never want to kill
 G5 D/F# E7sus4
absolutely still

Verse 2:
We were running
from the same noise,
We were stuck in
the same pursuit

Now the door's locked
and I find that
the dizzy madness
is bleeding through

Pre-Chorus:
  Bm                           G5
Promise me we'll never leave this room,
  Bm                                  G5 D/F# E7sus4
a million years from now would be too soon.

Chorus:
The world is spinning turning day to night
and my thoughts are running at the speed of light
Got an empty feeling that I never want to fill
absolutely still
I waited longer 'cause I needed proof
that every door I shut is leading me to you
and there's a nervous feeling that I never want to kill
absolutely still

Bridge: D/F# G D5 A

Pre-Chorus:
  Bm                           G5
Promise me we'll never leave this room,
  Bm                                   G5 D/F# E7sus4
a million years from now would be too soon.

Chorus:
The world is spinning turning day to night
and my thoughts are running at the speed of light
Got an empty feeling that I never want to fill
absolutely still
I waited longer 'cause I needed proof
that every door I shut is leading me to you
and there's a nervous feeling that I never want to kill
absolutely still

Final Chorus:
I'll go anywhere you want tonight
'cause my head is spinning like a satellite
I got a restless feeling that I never want to fill
I'm absolutely still
