<pre>The other tab for this song was really quite good, but it wasn't quite right... and I'm picky.

Plain White T's - Hey There Delilah


  D               F#m                              D                                    F#m
Hey there Delilah What's it like in New York City? I'm a thousand miles away But girl, tonight you look so pretty
  Bm             G                   A              Bm              A
Yes you do       Times Square can't shine as bright as you          I swear it's true
  D                         F#m                           D                                      F#m
Hey there Delilah Don't you worry about the distance I'm right there if you get lonely Give this song another listen
  Bm             G            A               Bm                   A
Close your eyes  Listen to my voice, it's my disguise  I'm by your side

Chorus
  D               Bm              D               Bm
Oh it's what you do to me      Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me      Oh it's what you do to me
  D              D/A  D
What you do to me

D                         F#m                              D                                    F#m
Hey there Delilah I know times are getting hard But just believe me, girl Someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar
                 Bm    G               A              Bm              A
We'll have it good     We'll have the life we knew we would My word is good
D                          F#m                            D                              F#m
Hey there Delilah I've got so much left to say If every simple song I wrote to you Would take your breath away
               Bm    G            A            Bm                       A
I'd write it all     Even more in love with me you'd fall We'd have it all

Chorus
  D               Bm              D               Bm
Oh it's what you do to me      Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me      Oh it's what you do to me
  D              D/A  D
What you do to me
  G                               A
A thousand miles seems pretty far But they've got planes and trains and cars
 D                                Bm
I'd walk to you if I had no other way
  G                                 A
Our friends would all make fun of us and we'll just laugh along because we know
  D                               Bm
That none of them have felt this way
  G                        A
Delilah I can promise you That by the time we get through
Bm
The world will never ever be the same
A
And you're to blame

D                         F#m                              D                                    F#m
Hey there Delilah You be good and don't you miss me Two more years and you'll be done with school
                                    Bm  
And I'll be making history like I do    
G                A                 Bm
You'll know it's all because of you
G         A                Bm             
We can do whatever we want to 
G         A                Bm                     A
Hey there Delilah here's to you This one's for you

  D               Bm              D               Bm
Oh it's what you do to me      Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me      Oh it's what you do to me
  D              D/A  D
What you do to me</pre>
